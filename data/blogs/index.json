          "The American motel is ingrained in our cultural psyche. Its retro iconography holds a powerful place on screen and in literature – from Jack Kerouac’s depictions of transient lodgings in On the Road to Don Draper’s lone travels in Mad Men.",
          "“There’s something deeply nostalgic and romantic about the classic American motel,” agrees Avi Brosh, founder of Palisociety. “My childhood trips were full of them. Pulling off the highway after a long drive, grabbing the keys from a tiny front desk, the hum of a neon sign outside the window. It wasn’t about luxury; it was about a feeling of freedom and togetherness. I think that emotional imprint stays with you.”",
          "Motels – a portmanteau of motor and hotel – were first conceived in the 1920s as roadside lodges. Defined by their low-slung architecture and bold signage, their popularity coincided with social and infrastructural shifts in postwar America. Their reach extends beyond the US, widely adopted across Australia, for example. “I have a strong memory of family bundling into the car on a Friday evening and finding a motel wherever it felt right,” recalls Melbourne-born Michael Parker, CEO of Roadbook. “That was the start of our weekend adventure. No plan, no concerns, just a car, endless country to enjoy and motels across the state.”"

          "Motels slowly fell out of fashion during the 1960s, reserved for Alfred Hitchcock and Wim Wenders films. 2025 marks 100 years of the motel and with it, a new era of reinvention. Hospitality brands such as Bunkhouse and Palisociety, alongside sharp-eyed independent hoteliers, are reinventing roadside motels as style-conscious stays where you can get your kicks again.",
          "“Motels offer a great architectural canvas,” says Brosh. “They’re often two-story, with exterior entrances and courtyard layouts that naturally foster a sense of community and openness. For hoteliers, that makes them both flexible and efficient to reimagine.”",
          "Motels are instilled with a sense of freedom, adventure and a hit the road mentality that goes against the grain of tick boxes and tight travel itineraries. They are more affordable than many hotels, while offering the warmth, service and stylish design of a boutique stay. Plus, you can often park your car right outside your room.",
          "In many ways, they are the antithesis of contactless check-ins and AI-driven spaces. Their intimacy fosters social connections – whether over poolside drinks or while picking up local tips in the lounge-lobby. “They’re smaller, more approachable, and naturally suited to personal service,” says Brosh. “People are drawn to motels because they feel authentic and grounded, not over-designed or intimidating, just familiar and human.”",
          "From Californian coastal stays to low-key desert hideaways and scenic stops on Route 66, these are our top motel picks in the US, worth extending your road trip for."

          "In 1995, Liz Lambert traded in her career as a lawyer to buy a desolate motel on South Congress Avenue in Austin. She has since become one of the industry’s most influential hoteliers, credited with turning South Congress Avenue into the buzzy thoroughfare it is today. She founded Bunkhouse Hotels, which she sold to Standard International in 2015, before departing the business in 2019. The motel that started it all, Hotel San José, remains one of the best in town. Lambert’s design legacy endures in the rooms and social spaces, which are modern and minimalist, with cowhide rugs and framed graphic art. Large arched windows overlook the central pool and leafy courtyard, where there is live music every Thursday."

          "Along the road from Hotel San José is Austin Motel, Liz Lambert’s second hotel project under the Bunkhouse Hotels umbrella. Bold interiors draw on the building’s retro roots, with wildly wallpapered rooms with curvy leather headboards. It is known for its phallus-shaped neon sign, and you can pick up branded merch at the onsite shop. Swim passes and preferential rates for Texans mean there is always a local crowd hanging by the pool, while weekly events include Honky Tonk pool parties and al fresco film screenings."
